1 - issue Details:
If an attacker were to supply an excessively large expiry timestamp, exceeding type(uint96).max, it could lead to an integer overflow in the comparison expiry > block.timestamp. Integer overflow can have unintended consequences and potentially allow an attacker to exploit vulnerabilities elsewhere in the contract.
here is the function :https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-09-delegate/blob/a6dbac8068760ee4fc5bababb57e3fe79e5eeb2e/src/libraries/DelegateTokenLib.sol#L107C3-L112C1 by adding this can fix the issue 
--require(expiry > block.timestamp, "Expiry must be in the future");
--require(expiry < type(uint96).max, "Expiry exceeds maximum allowed value");
}

 This  loadFrom function retrieves the "from" address associated with a registryHash. It s should not revert if the delegation has been revoked or never existed.

3 - issue Details:
- in this line of contract https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-09-delegate/blob/a6dbac8068760ee4fc5bababb57e3fe79e5eeb2e/src/libraries/DelegateTokenRegistryHelpers.sol#L52C4-L52C39
- This function loadTokenHolderAndContract function is combines the functionality of loading both the delegate token holder and underlying contract it's should ensure that these values are used correctly in your contract.
