 Lack of Input Validation
Impact
The contract does not perform proper input validation in functions like delegateERC20, delegateERC721, and delegateERC1155. Lack of input validation can lead to unexpected behavior and vulnerabilities.

Proof of Concept
Malicious users can provide invalid or malicious inputs to these functions, potentially causing unexpected state changes or errors.

Recommended Mitigation Steps
Input Validation: Implement input validation checks to ensure that the provided inputs are valid and within expected ranges.

Use Require Statements: Use require statements to check input conditions and revert the transaction if conditions are not met.

Sanitize Inputs: Ensure that all inputs are properly sanitized to prevent any potential vulnerabilities.
