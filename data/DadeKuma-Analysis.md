## [01] High-level architecture

## [02] Analysis of the codebase

- The overall architecture of Delegate has a structured, simple, and modular design, which enhances its overall quality.
- Codebase quality is **high**, but it's recommeded to add more extensive comments that explain each step in the process, especially for the extensive use of assembly code in DelegateRegistry.
- Test quality is **high**, the use of fuzzing tests is well appreciated as it covers many edge cases.
- Test coverage could be improved (it's currently 80%), especially for the Seaport integration.

## [03] Architecture feedback

- The architecture appears robust and secure, with a focus on immutability, and flexibility. It eliminates centralized admin powers and minimizes external dependencies, reducing potential risks.
- The inclusion of subdelegations and the ability to split delegation rights for various use cases demonstrate a well-thought-out architecture catering to diverse user needs, in comparison to V1.
- The heavy use of optimized assembly code to pack state variables is great for reducing gas usage, but it might potentially introduce non-obvious bugs.
- The architecture in general appears well-suited for a wide range of use cases, offering a robust solution for securing different on-chain assets and enabling various interactions securely.

## [04] Centralization risks

- The architecture's commitment to immutability and decentralized control mitigates centralization risks.
- The absence of external dependencies and a centralized admin ensures that the system's security and functionality are not subject to unilateral changes.

## [05] Systemic risks

- The integration with Seaport and the alternative Delegate token creation needs special attention to edge cases, as it's non-standard (it's possible to create Delegate tokens without using the `create` function).
- The lack of SIP integrations could cause integration issues with other Seaport applications, or Seaport itself (e.g. for indexing)
