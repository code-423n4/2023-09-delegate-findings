# Delegate v2 Advanced  Analysis Report

## Introduction 

The delegate registry is a standalone singleton database that aggregates onchain programmable access control. Users can link cold wallets to hot wallets, or specify individual token rights to delegate to other wallets. This separation of asset utility from the asset owner is a powerful primitive that enables the delegate marketplace. The delegate marketplace lets users wrap delegation rights into ERC721 tokens that can then be traded or transferred in the same way as any other NFT. The primary use-case here is utility rentals with zero counterparty risk, zero liquidation risk, zero overcollateralization requirements, and an order of magnitude greater capital efficiency.

## Mechanism Review 

### 1 . DelegateRegistry.sol

**Data Structures**
The contract employs several data structures and mappings to store delegation information:

 - **delegations:** A mapping that associates a delegation hash with an array of five bytes32 values for each delegation.
 - **outgoingDelegationHashes and incomingDelegationHashes:** Mappings that store delegation hashes associated with addresses, allowing enumeration of delegations.

**Write Functions**

The contract provides various functions for users to delegate different types of permissions:

   - **delegateAll:** Allows an address to delegate all permissions to another address.
   - **delegateContract:** Allows an address to delegate permissions to interact with a specific contract.
    - **delegateERC721 and delegateERC1155:** Allow an address to delegate permissions to transfer ERC721 and ERC1155 tokens.
    - **delegateERC20:** Allows an address to delegate permissions to transfer ERC20 tokens.
   - **sweep:** Allows for transferring native tokens out of the contract.

**Check Functions**

The contract provides check functions to verify delegation permissions:

  - **checkDelegateForAll:** Checks if an address has delegated all permissions to another address.
   - **checkDelegateForContract:** Checks if an address has delegated permissions for a specific contract.
   - **checkDelegateForERC721 and checkDelegateForERC1155:** Check if an address has delegated permissions for transferring ERC721 and ERC1155 tokens.
   - **checkDelegateForERC20:** Checks if an address has delegated permissions for transferring ERC20 tokens.

**Enumerations**
The contract includes functions to enumerate delegations:

  - **getIncomingDelegations and getOutgoingDelegations:** Retrieve arrays of valid delegations.
   - **getIncomingDelegationHashes and getOutgoingDelegationHashes:** Retrieve arrays of valid delegation hashes.
   - **getDelegationsFromHashes:** Retrieve Delegation structs based on an array of delegation hashes.

**External Storage Access**

The contract provides functions to read storage slots:

  - **readSlot:** Reads a single storage slot.
  - **readSlots:** Reads multiple storage slots.
**ERC165 Support**

The contract implements the supportsInterface function to indicate support for the IDelegateRegistry interface and an arbitrary interface with the identifier 0x01ffc9a7.

**Internal Helper Functions**

The contract includes several internal helper functions to manipulate and validate delegation data, manage delegation hashes, and handle addresses packed in storage slots.

**Additional Considerations**

The contract appears to have a self-destruct function (sweep) that transfers native tokens to a specified address, which should be updated with the correct address before deployment.
The contract uses inline assembly for some operations, potentially for gas optimization.


### 2 . RegistryHashes.sol

**Library Purpose:**

This library is meant to provide utility functions for encoding and decoding delegation information in a delegate registry contract.

**Types of Delegations:**

The library supports five types of delegations: ALL, CONTRACT, ERC721, ERC20, and ERC1155. Each type has a specific hash and storage location.

**Constants:**

The library defines several internal constants for delegation types, storage slots, and a mask for extracting the last byte of a word.

**Helper Functions:**

  - **decodeType(bytes32 inputHash):** This function decodes the delegation type from a hash.
  - **location(bytes32 inputHash):** Computes the storage location for a given delegation hash.

Functions for each delegation type (ALL, CONTRACT, ERC721, ERC20, ERC1155) to calculate the delegation hash and location.

**Encoding and Hashing:**

The library uses low-level assembly code to efficiently encode and hash delegation information. It calculates hashes based on the delegation type and provided parameters.
The resulting hash includes the type information in the last byte to avoid collisions between hash types.

**Input Validation:**

The library ensures that addresses (from, to, contract_) are cleaned to their last 20 bytes if they exceed uint160 to prevent potential errors.
The library doesn't revert if the decoded type exceeds the range of the IDelegateRegistry.DelegationType enum. However, this could lead to issues if used incorrectly.



**Safety Considerations:**

The library uses inline assembly ("memory-safe") to manage memory and perform calculations. While the code appears to be well-structured, inline assembly can introduce security risks if not implemented correctly.

**Lack of External Access Control:**

This library does not provide access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized contracts or users can perform delegation-related actions. Access control should be implemented in the delegate registry contract that uses this library.

**Documentation:**

The library includes comments explaining the purpose and usage of its functions, which is good for readability and maintainability.


### 3 . RegistryStorage.sol


**Constants:**

- The library defines several internal constants, including DELEGATION_EMPTY and DELEGATION_REVOKED, which are used as sentinel values to represent empty and revoked delegations, respectively.
- It also defines constants like POSITIONS_FIRST_PACKED, POSITIONS_SECOND_PACKED, POSITIONS_RIGHTS, POSITIONS_TOKEN_ID, and POSITIONS_AMOUNT to standardize storage positions for various data elements.

**Helper Functions:**

- **packAddresses(address from, address to, address contract_):** This function takes three addresses (from, to, and contract_) and packs them into two bytes32 values (firstPacked and secondPacked). It uses bitwise operations (shl and or) to ensure that the addresses are properly packed into the storage slots.
- **unpackAddresses(bytes32 firstPacked, bytes32 secondPacked):** This function does the reverse of packAddresses. It takes the packed values and unpacks them into their respective addresses (from, to, and contract_).
- **unpackAddress(bytes32 packedSlot):** This function is used to unpack either the from or to address from their respective packed slots.

**Cleaning Bits:**

The library uses several constants (CLEAN_ADDRESS, CLEAN_FIRST8_BYTES_ADDRESS, and CLEAN_PACKED8_BYTES_ADDRESS) to clean or mask out certain bits in the addresses during packing and unpacking operations. This ensures that any dirty bits outside the last 20 bytes of the addresses are removed.

**Comments and Documentation:**

The code includes comments that explain the purpose of each constant and function, making it easier for developers to understand how to use the library.

### 4 . RegistryOps.sol

**1 . max(uint256 x, uint256 y):**

 - **Purpose:** This function calculates the maximum value between two unsigned integers (x and y) and returns the result.
 - **Operation:** It uses assembly code to perform the operation in a gas-efficient manner.
**Explanation:**
 - The function utilizes the assembly keyword to access low-level bitwise operations.
- It checks if y is greater than x using gt(y, x), which evaluates to 1 if y is greater than x and 0 otherwise.
- If y is greater, it computes x ^ ((x ^ y) * 1) using bitwise XOR (^) and multiplication (mul). This results in y as the output.
- If y is not greater, it computes x ^ ((x ^ y) * 0), which simplifies to x.
Note: This function is optimized for gas efficiency but may be less readable than a straightforward conditional statement.

**2 . and(bool x, bool y):**

  **Purpose:** This function performs a logical AND operation on two boolean values (x and y) and returns the result.
 **Operation:** It uses assembly code to optimize the operation.
**Explanation:**
- It utilizes assembly to work with boolean values as if they were integers (0 for false and 1 for true).
- It applies and(iszero(iszero(x)), iszero(iszero(y))) to calculate the logical AND of x and y. This expression effectively checks if both x and y are true (1).
- The comment in the code notes that the compiler automatically cleans dirty booleans on the stack to 1, and the function does the same.

**3 . or(bool x, bool y):**

**Purpose:** This function performs a logical OR operation on two boolean values (x and y) and returns the result.
**Operation:** Similar to the and function, it uses assembly code for optimization.
**Explanation:**
- It employs assembly to handle boolean values as integers (0 for false and 1 for true).
- It calculates the logical OR of x and y with or(iszero(iszero(x)), iszero(iszero(y))). This expression effectively checks if either x or y is true (1).
- Like the and function, it acknowledges that the compiler automatically cleans dirty booleans on the stack to 1, and the function follows suit.

### 5 . DelegateToken.sol

**Immutables:**

The contract declares three immutable addresses: delegateRegistry, principalToken, and marketMetadata. These addresses are set during contract deployment and cannot be changed afterward.

**Storage Variables:**

The contract uses several internal mappings to manage token balances and approvals:
   - balances: Maps delegate token holders to their token balances.
   - accountOperator: Allows for operator approvals for token holders.
   - delegateTokenInfo: Stores information about each delegate token, including its holder, approved address, and other details.

**Constructor:**

This internal function is used to check if the caller of certain functions is the delegateToken. It reverts if the caller is not the delegateToken.

**Mint Function mint:**

The mint function allows the delegateToken contract to mint a PrincipalToken NFT and assign it to a specified address (to). This operation can only be performed by the delegateToken contract, and it triggers the mintAuthorizedCallback function on the delegateToken contract.

**Burn Function burn:**

The burn function allows the delegateToken contract to burn a PrincipalToken NFT. However, certain conditions must be met:
    - The caller must be the delegateToken contract.
    - The specified spender must be approved or the owner of the NFT.
    - The owner of the DelegateToken must authorize the burn through the burnAuthorizedCallback function on the delegateToken contract.

**isApprovedOrOwner Function:**

This function allows external callers to check if a specific account is approved or the owner of a given PrincipalToken NFT.

**tokenURI Function:**

The tokenURI function overrides the standard ERC721 tokenURI function to provide a URI for a specific PrincipalToken NFT. It ensures that the NFT has been minted and then calls the principalTokenURI function in the MarketMetadata contract to retrieve the URI.
